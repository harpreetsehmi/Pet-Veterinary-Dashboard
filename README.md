Pet Veterinary Dashboard

Project Introduction
The React Frontend Project Journey repository serves as a comprehensive guide for developing the front end of a React application. The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly and visually appealing web application using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Getting Started
Before diving into the development process, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
Git
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/harpreetsehmi/Pet-Veterinary-Dashboard.git

Development Phases

Project Setup
In this phase, I have set up the initial structure of our React application. This has included creating the project, installing necessary dependencies, and organizing the file structure.

Component Development
Here, I have started creating individual React components that make up our application's UI. I have focused on building reusable and well-structured components.

State Management
State management has been crucial for handling data that changes over time. I have explored different state management solutions, such as React's built-in state, useState, useEffect, or popular libraries.

Routing
To create multi-page applications, I have implemented routing using libraries like React Router. This has allowed me to navigate between different views or components.

Styling
Styling has played a significant role in the user experience. I have covered various approaches to styling, including CSS-in-JS libraries, CSS, and Sass.

Data Fetching
Modern applications often rely on external data. I have learned how to fetch data from APIs and update our components accordingly using tools like fetch or libraries like Axios.

Regression Testing
I have performed the regression testing. Regression Testing is a type of testing in the software development cycle that runs after every change to ensure that the change introduces no unintended breaks.
